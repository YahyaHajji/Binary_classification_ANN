# Binary Classification ANN

## Description
This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for binary classification tasks. The model is designed to classify data points into two distinct categories, utilizing machine learning techniques to achieve high accuracy.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YahyaHajji/Binary_classification_ANN.git
   cd Binary_classification_ANN
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To train the ANN model and evaluate its performance, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can adjust hyperparameters and model architecture in the `main.py` file as needed.
